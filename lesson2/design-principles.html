                <p>Alignment of a page really sets the stage for structure, organization, and readability
                    for that Website. Alignment specifically deals with where items are on a page and where
                    those items are in relation to each other.  I picked
                    this Website because it uses many different vertical and horizontal alignment options.
                    This site uses top/bottom vertical alignment (aligning either the top or the bottom of 
                    items in a row), left/right hortizontal alignment (aligning all items on the left of the
                    page and the right of the page), center horizontal alignment (aligning items in the center
                    of the page), as well as edge alignment (vertical and horizontal alignment for more than
                    one corner of the page). This site aligned their page properly because they looked at the 
                    page as a whole and not just each individual item.

                <p>Repetition provides a cohesive environment between elements in a Webpage. Really,
                    I could have picked any Website because most web designers know and follow this rule.
                    I picked this Website because the navigation structure is the same no matter what
                    page you go to, and there are many. They also have the same layout, schemes, color,
                    styles, and fonts throughout every page (with minor changes). The brand is used in the
                    header and footer and each header and footer are the same throughtout all pages. It
                    is a simple but effective design that has great reptition.

                <img src="image/www.lushusa.com_.png" alt="Lush Website Screenshot">
                <p>Contrast is the distinct difference between the forground and the background of a Website
                    that enhances readability. I chose this specific Website to represent contrast because 
                    there is so much of it on this site. You have a dark header and footer with light body.
                    You also have blocks of elements within the site with dark backgrounds and light text,
                    and light backgrounds with dark text. Lastlly, there is plenty of white space, your eyes are 
                    drawn to all the right places on the site, and all the colors used on this Website are 
                    cohesive.
