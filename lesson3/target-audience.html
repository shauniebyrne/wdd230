            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <h4>Business Owners</h4>
            <p>A part of the audience that will visit this CornChamber site is the businesses that opt into being a member of Taber's
                Chamber of Commerce. They will be able to view their businesses advertising and what events are coming up in the community.
                This will help them know when to plan special events of their own. They will also be able to view the advertising that will
                be on the site for their events. Businesses that are not members yet, will come to this site to see what will be available 
                to them if they do sign up. They will be able to browse the site, see the different levels of membership and what benefits
                 there are. They will also be able to see what businesses in the city are already members of the Taber Chamber of Commerce.
                This site will give these businesses a step up in the community and a place for them to be able to join together and make
                necessary changes in the community.
            </p>
            <p>Another audience, that is still apart of the 'Business Owners' audience, is the Taber Chamber of Commerces Board of Directors. 
                The businesses that are members will be able to vote whom among them they would like to be on the Board. This gives all an
                incentive to have this site be a success and therefore will make sure it is kept up to date and will ensure they visit it
                often.
            </p>
            <h4>Citizens of Taber and Surrounding Area, Tourists</h4>
            <p>A second audience that will visit this site is the Town of Taber's community members, or the citizens. They will visit this 
                site to see what businesses there are in their community and what they have to offer them. They will also visit to see what
                events are up and coming within the community. Individuals that live around Taber will also be able to visit this site to
                see what businesses are here and what events, if any, they want to travel for and join. Lastly, tourists that are wanting
                to travel to Taber and its surrounding area will visit this site to see what is available. They will see what businesses are
