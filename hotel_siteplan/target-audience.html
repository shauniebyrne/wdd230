        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Temple Workers</h3>
            <p>A large audience that will use this site is the people that travel to work
                at the temples. This will include people that come every day to help with 
                the ordinaces, people that work in the temple offices, and people that come
                to work on the temple itself. When these people travel far to come to the
                temple, they will need a place to stay. This site will not only give them a
                way to be able to book their room, but also to see what the hotel offers 
                them.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Temple Patrons and Their Families</h3>
            <p>Many endowed members sacrifice and travel far to visit a temple. Since
                it is a far distance, many also bring their family members along and make it a family
                holiday trip. When this is the case, they will need a place to stay. This site
                will allow these families to not only book rooms, but also see what they have 
                available to them for entertainment (especially for the unendowed family members). They
                will be able to see exactly what the hotel provides and be able to plan their holiday
                accordingly. Also, before these families go on their trip, this site will help them be able
                to learn more about the temple they are visiting. There will also be temple patrons that
                come by themselves, these patrons will also be able to do all that was mentioned 
                above.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Youth (For Temple Trips)</h3>
            <p>Many youth in the Young Women and Young Men's programs along with their leaders save
                up and go on temple trips. As such, they too will need a place to stay and need to 
                know what is available to them for entertainment. This site will provide both of those
                necessary things for them. They too will be able to plan for their trip with this 
                website by looking up the temple they are going to and learning more about it.
